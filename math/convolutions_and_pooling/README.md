# Convolutions and Pooling in Neural Networks

**Project Author**: Alexa Orrico, Software Engineer at Holberton School

## Project Overview

This project explores the fundamentals of convolutions and pooling operations used in image processing, particularly within Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By implementing basic image transformations like edge detection and feature extraction, we gain a better understanding of how CNNs process visual data. 

**Project Duration**: October 20, 2024 - October 27, 2024  
**Requirements**: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Python 3.5, numpy 1.15, pycodestyle 2.5

---

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand key concepts such as convolution, pooling, kernels, padding, and stride.
- Implement different convolution and pooling techniques (e.g., "valid" and "same" padding, max pooling).
- Apply convolutions over volumes and perform operations across multiple channels in images.

---

## Requirements

- Code should conform to `pycodestyle` (version 2.5).
- Documentation is required for each module, class, and function.
- Use only `numpy` and `math` libraries; no other imports are allowed.
- Each file should be executable and follow Unix line-endings (`\n`).

## Project Structure

This project is structured into a series of tasks to progressively build your understanding and implementation of convolutional and pooling layers in neural networks.

### Task List

1. **Valid Convolution** (`0-convolve_grayscale_valid.py`)
    - Perform valid convolutions on grayscale images.
    
2. **Same Convolution** (`1-convolve_grayscale_same.py`)
    - Implement convolution with "same" padding on grayscale images.

3. **Convolution with Padding** (`2-convolve_grayscale_padding.py`)
    - Perform convolution on grayscale images with custom padding.

4. **Strided Convolution** (`3-convolve_grayscale.py`)
    - Implement convolution with both padding and stride parameters.

5. **Convolution with Channels** (`4-convolve_channels.py`)
    - Perform convolution on images with multiple channels (e.g., RGB).

6. **Multiple Kernels** (`5-convolve.py`)
    - Use multiple kernels to perform convolution on images with channels.

7. **Pooling** (`6-pool.py`)
    - Implement pooling operations (max and average pooling).

## Usage

To execute each script, navigate to the project directory and run the corresponding Python file, for example:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
```

Each main file (e.g., `0-main.py`, `1-main.py`) loads sample data, applies the function, and visualizes both the original and transformed images using `matplotlib`.

---

## Testing

To run tests:
1. Download and extract the required dataset.
2. Verify that your files meet the length restrictions (`wc` command).
3. Ensure all files are executable.
