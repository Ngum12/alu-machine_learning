## 💻 Code Examples

### Poisson Distribution

```python
import numpy as np
from poisson import Poisson

np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.poisson(5., 100).tolist()
p1 = Poisson(data)
print('Lambtha:', p1.lambtha)
print('P(9):', p1.pmf(9))
print('F(9):', p1.cdf(9))

# Output:
# Lambtha: 4.84
# P(9): 0.03175849616802446
# F(9): 0.9736102067423525
```

### Normal Distribution

```python
import numpy as np
from normal import Normal

np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.normal(70, 10, 100).tolist()
n1 = Normal(data)
print('Mean:', n1.mean, ', Stddev:', n1.stddev)
print('Z(90):', n1.z_score(90))
print('X(2):', n1.x_value(2))
print('PSI(90):', n1.pdf(90))
print('PHI(90):', n1.cdf(90))

# Output:
# Mean: 70.59808015534485 , Stddev: 10.078822447165797
# Z(90): 1.9250185174272068
# X(2): 90.75572504967644
# PSI(90): 0.006206096804434349
# PHI(90): 0.982902011086006

## 🧠 Probability Brain Teaser

**Click to reveal a probability puzzle!**

<details>
<summary>Puzzle</summary>

You have three cards: one is red on both sides, one is blue on both sides, and one is red on one side and blue on the other. You pick a card at random and look at one side. It's red. What's the probability that the other side is also red?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The probability is 2/3! There are three red sides total, two of which are on the double-red card. So if you see a red side, it's twice as likely to be from the double-red card than from the mixed card.

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

Probability is the backbone of data science and machine learning. As you progress through this project, you'll gain invaluable insights into the mathematical foundations that power modern AI and predictive analytics. 

Remember, in the world of probability, everything is possible – some things are just more likely than others! 

Happy calculating! 🎉🔢🎲 🎲 Probability Amateur
